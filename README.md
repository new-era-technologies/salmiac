The page should be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to add any kind of JS libs like jQuery, WOW.js, etc. Also, we are recommending to use Bootstrap CSS grid since the design is adapted to this framework.

Please, use only native HTML. Donâ€™t use any templating engines (such as Pug) or CMS.

Please, use only SCSS as a preprocessor or use native CSS.

Do not use js frameworks like Angular, React, VueJS, etc.

The page should be created following the mockup exactly. You can export all the files from Figma directly or use sliced assets. For this test, we prefer quality over quantity, so please pay attention to details (paddings, margins, font sizes, and line-heights, etc.).

Please keep in mind that we usually adapt the page to 3 main screen sizes: mobile, laptop, and full HD.


Special requirements: 

On the screen sizes larger than 1199px the Intro (header) section should have a parallax effect on the background implemented by using background-attachment: fixed

Please, use Open Sans font from the Google Fonts repository.

This button should scroll the viewport to the form section: https://i.imgur.com/FZGjshl.png 

These icons should have an animation: https://i.imgur.com/ibxFGbm.png 
Make them appear one by one. Feel free to use WOW.js lib or just use simple CSS animation.
 
Same animation task for these logos: https://i.imgur.com/p7uljPU.png 

Slider should contain 6 slides: https://i.imgur.com/M1Ll9oj.png Just clone an existing ones. Usually, our coders use Slick.js or Swiper to implement any kind of slider. Feel free to use any other slider library if you want.
